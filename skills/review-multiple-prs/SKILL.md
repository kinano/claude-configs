# Review Multiple PRs (Parallel)

Use this skill when the user provides 2 or more PR numbers or URLs to review. Unlike `/code-review` (which processes PRs sequentially), this skill fans out to parallel agents — one per PR — then merges their findings into a unified summary.

---

## Step 0 — Verify `gh` auth and repo access

1. Run `gh auth status`. If unauthenticated, stop and tell the user.
2. Resolve the repo identity: if PR URLs were provided, extract `owner/repo` from them. Otherwise run `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner` to get the repo from the current directory context. Store this as `{owner}/{repo}` — it is required for API calls in Step 5.
3. Run `gh repo view {owner}/{repo}` to confirm read access. If it fails, stop and tell the user.

## Step 1 — Identify and classify the PRs

- Collect all PR numbers / URLs from the user's message.
- If no PRs are specified, run the **PR Discovery** flow below before proceeding.
- If fewer than 2 PRs are provided (and discovery was not run), redirect the user to `/code-review` instead.

### PR Discovery (when no PRs are specified)

Use `gh` and the GitHub search API to find open PRs by the user's teammates that are awaiting review. Run these steps:

1. **Resolve the org:** extract the org from the `{owner}/{repo}` resolved in Step 0 (e.g. `ProjectAussie`).

2. **Find teammate usernames:** ask the user for a list of names or GitHub handles to search for. If they provide display names (e.g. "Claire", "Tom McT"), resolve them to GitHub logins by searching org members:
   ```
   gh api 'orgs/{org}/members' --paginate --jq '.[] | select(.login | test("{name}"; "i")) | .login'
   ```

3. **Find open PRs by those authors:**
   ```
   gh search prs --state open --author {login} --json number,title,url,author,repository --limit 20
   ```
   Run one search per author. Collect all results.

4. **Filter to actionable PRs only** — for each PR, fetch its review status and check whether the current user has already reviewed:

   a. Get the current user's login:
      ```
      gh api user --jq .login
      ```

   b. Get PR metadata:
      ```
      gh pr view <number> -R <owner/repo> --json reviewDecision,isDraft,reviewRequests
      ```

   c. Get the current user's most recent review on this PR (if any) and the latest commit date:
      ```
      gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews --jq '[.[] | select(.user.login == "{current_user}")] | sort_by(.submitted_at) | last | {state: .state, submitted_at: .submitted_at}'
      ```
      ```
      gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/commits --jq 'last | .commit.committer.date'
      ```

   d. Keep only PRs where **all** of the following are true:
      - `isDraft: false`
      - `reviewDecision` is NOT excluded — include all values: `"REVIEW_REQUIRED"`, `""` (empty), `"APPROVED"`, and `"CHANGES_REQUESTED"` (someone else may have requested changes — you still need to review)

   e. **Skip PRs where the current user is already waiting on the author:**
      - If the current user's most recent review `state` is `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, AND
      - The latest commit on the PR is **older** than the review's `submitted_at` timestamp (meaning no new commits since the review)
      - Then **exclude** this PR — it's waiting on the author to push changes, not on you to re-review
      - If the author has pushed new commits after your CHANGES_REQUESTED review, **include** it — it needs a follow-up review

5. **Bucket by requester type** (reuse the current user's login from step 4a — do not fetch it again):**
   - **Your individual review:** PRs where `reviewRequests` contains the current user's login
   - **Team approval:** PRs with `REVIEW_REQUIRED` but no individual review request for you — these are waiting on a team

6. **Present the list to the user** grouped by author and bucket, with URLs. If any PRs were skipped because the current user is waiting on the author, list them separately:

   > **Skipped (waiting on author after your CHANGES_REQUESTED):**
   > - {owner}/{repo}#{number} — {title} — last reviewed {date}, no new commits since

   Then ask: "Should I review all of these, or select a subset? I can also include the skipped PRs if you want to re-review them."

7. Once the user confirms the set, continue with the normal Step 1 classification flow using those PRs.
- For each PR, run `gh pr view <number> --json number,title,state,isDraft,baseRefName,headRefName,createdAt` to get metadata.
- Determine the relationship between the PRs:

  | Relationship | Definition | Review strategy |
  |---|---|---|
  | **Stacked** | Each PR targets the previous PR's branch | Review in merge order; pass raw diff context forward |
  | **Parallel** | Multiple PRs for the same feature, split by concern | Review independently; flag integration risks |
  | **Batch / Unrelated** | Unrelated changes reviewed together (e.g. release batch) | Review fully independently |

- State your interpretation to the user and **wait for explicit confirmation before fanning out**. Do not proceed until the user confirms or corrects the relationship classification. A misclassified stacked set will silently skip context forwarding — this confirmation gate is not optional.

## Step 2 — Fan out: one agent per PR

Spin up one Agent per PR using `subagent_type: general-purpose`. Name each agent after a unique American outlaw from the 1800s–1900s (e.g. Jesse James, Belle Starr, Black Bart, Dutch Schultz, Pretty Boy Floyd, Billy the Kid, Bonnie Parker). Names must be unique per session — do not reuse a name even if reviewing many PRs.

Each agent receives a self-contained prompt with:

1. The PR number, repo (`{owner}/{repo}`), and `is_draft` flag.
2. Instructions to:
   - Fetch the diff: `gh pr diff <number>` — save this output; it is the authoritative source of changed lines for inline comment line numbers
   - Read the PR metadata and conversation comments: `gh pr view <number> --comments`
   - Fetch **formal review state** — this is critical, `--comments` does NOT include formal reviews:
     ```
     gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews --jq '.[] | {user: .user.login, state: .state, body: .body}'
     ```
     This returns `APPROVED`, `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, `COMMENTED`, `DISMISSED`, or `PENDING` per reviewer. A `DISMISSED` review means a maintainer overrode it — note who dismissed and why.
   - Fetch **inline review thread comments** (these are separate from PR conversation comments):
     ```
     gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments --jq '.[] | {user: .user.login, path: .path, line: .line, body: .body, created_at: .created_at}'
     ```
   - Read all of the above **before forming any verdict** — see the mandatory "Prior Discussion & Deferred Decisions" dimension in Step 3
   - Check CI: `gh pr checks <number>` — note that this only shows current run state; to assess whether failures are pre-existing, also run `gh pr checks <base-branch>` or `gh pr checks $(gh pr view <number> --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName)` for comparison. If base-branch checks are also failing, mark `ci_failures_introduced_by_pr: false`.
   - Read the linked Jira ticket via the Atlassian MCP if a ticket key is found in the branch name or PR description
   - Read surrounding code for any renamed functions, changed contracts, or modified public APIs
3. **For stacked PRs only:** the raw output of `gh pr diff <prior-number>` from the prior agent — passed verbatim, not summarized — so the agent understands what the prior layer changed and can attribute findings to the correct PR.
4. **Draft PR behavior:** if `is_draft: true`, the agent must still review and produce findings, but must set `verdict: "COMMENT"` unconditionally. It should post inline comments on Github (authors expect feedback on drafts) but the summary must clearly label the PR as a draft.
5. The review dimensions to evaluate (see Step 3 below)
6. The finding severity scale (see Step 4 below)
7. Instructions to **return findings as structured JSON** (see Output Contract below)

Run all agents in parallel (single message, multiple tool calls) **unless** the PRs are stacked — in that case, run them sequentially in merge order so each agent gets the prior layer's raw diff as context.

### Output Contract

Each agent must return a JSON object with exactly these fields:

```json
{
  "pr": 123,
  "title": "...",
  "verdict": "APPROVE",
  "is_draft": false,
  "ci_status": "passing",
  "ci_failures_introduced_by_pr": false,
  "stacked_context_diff": "<raw output of gh pr diff for this PR — included only for stacked PRs, to pass forward to the next agent>",
  "findings": [
    {
      "severity": "BLOCKER",
      "file": "path/to/file.ts",
      "line": 42,
      "body": "..."
    }
  ],
  "prior_discussions": [
    {
      "author": "<github username of the person who raised the concern>",
      "summary": "brief description of the prior comment or concern",
      "status": "accepted | unresolved | addressed_in_code",
      "original_severity": "BLOCKER | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW | QUESTION",
      "file": "path/to/file.ts (optional — only if the concern was about a specific file)",
      "line": 42,
      "reasoning": "why this status was assigned — e.g. 'reviewer replied OK to defer' or 'no response from reviewer after author acknowledged'"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "2–4 sentence summary of what the PR does and overall quality"
}
```

Valid `verdict` values: `"APPROVE"`, `"REQUEST_CHANGES"`, `"COMMENT"`.

**Line number constraint:** every finding with a `line` value must reference a line that actually appears in the diff output from `gh pr diff`. Do not invent or approximate line numbers — a line number not in the diff will cause the GitHub API to reject the comment with a 422 error.

## Step 3 — Review dimensions (per PR)

Each agent evaluates:

### Correctness
- Does the code do what the PR description says?
- Off-by-one errors, missing null checks, unhandled edge cases?
- Are error paths handled?

### Security
- OWASP Top 10: injection, broken auth, insecure deserialization, XSS, etc.
- Hardcoded secrets? Inputs validated at system boundaries?
- Least-privilege principle followed?

### Design & Simplicity
- Is the abstraction level appropriate?
- Unnecessary indirection or over-engineering?
- Could anything be deleted with no behavior change?

### Readability & Maintainability
- Clear variable and function names?
- Complex logic commented where intent isn't obvious?
- Dead code, debug artifacts, commented-out blocks left in?

### Test Coverage
- Tests for the new behavior?
- Do existing tests still make sense? Are mocks hiding real integration issues?
- Edge cases covered?

### Prior Discussion & Deferred Decisions

Agents **must** complete this section before forming a verdict. Omitting it is a review failure — populate the `prior_discussions` array in the Output Contract even if empty.

#### Data sources

Use **all three** data sources together — each one shows different things:

| Source | What it shows | Command |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| PR conversation comments | Top-level discussion | `gh pr view <number> --comments` |
| Formal review state | `APPROVED`, `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, `DISMISSED` per reviewer | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews` |
| Inline review thread comments | Line-level reviewer concerns | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments` |

#### Identifying deferred or prior concerns

Scan **reviewer comment threads** (not PR description, not commit messages) for phrases that indicate deferral: "we'll fix this later", "out of scope for this PR", "follow-up ticket", "known issue", "accepted risk", or similar.

Do **not** treat the following as deferral signals:
- `TODO` comments in the code diff (those are code annotations, not reviewer deferrals)
- Language in the PR description or commit messages authored by the PR submitter (that's the author pre-framing, not a reviewer decision)
- Emoji reactions (thumbs-up, etc.) — these carry no formal semantic weight and must not be used to classify deferral status

#### Assigning severity to prior concerns

Prior reviewer comments do not use this skill's severity taxonomy. When a prior concern has no explicit severity, assign one based on impact:
- A concern about correctness, data loss, or security → `BLOCKER` or `HIGH`
- A concern about design, maintainability, or missing tests → `MEDIUM`
- A concern about style, naming, or minor cleanup → `LOW`

Document your severity assignment and reasoning in the `reasoning` field of the `prior_discussions` entry.

#### Status classification rules

| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **accepted** | The **reviewer who raised the concern** (not the author) explicitly accepted the deferral — e.g., replied "OK to defer", "fine for now", submitted a new `APPROVED` review after discussion. Author acknowledgment alone is **not** sufficient. If the reviewer went silent after the author acknowledged, classify as `unresolved` — reviewer silence does not equal acceptance. |
| **addressed_in_code** | The concern was addressed by a code change. **You must verify this** — cross-reference the PR diff to confirm the fix is actually present. A comment saying "fixed" or "done" without a corresponding code change means the status is `unresolved`, not `addressed_in_code`. |
| **unresolved** | Anything else: no reply, author disputed it without reviewer resolution, reviewer went silent, or the formal review state is still `CHANGES_REQUESTED` and not `DISMISSED`. |

#### Formal review state handling

- If a reviewer's formal review state is `CHANGES_REQUESTED` and has **not** been `DISMISSED`: that review is still active. Check whether the specific concerns raised in that review have been addressed in code or accepted by the reviewer.
- If a review was `DISMISSED`: note who dismissed it (the reviewer themselves, or a maintainer). A maintainer-dismissed review without a replacement approval should still be surfaced as a prior discussion — it may indicate an override that the human reviewer should see.

#### Verdict interaction

- **Any single `unresolved` prior concern with `original_severity` of BLOCKER prevents an `APPROVE` verdict.** This is absolute.
- `unresolved` HIGHs should result in `REQUEST_CHANGES` unless you have strong evidence the concern is stale (e.g., the code it referenced no longer exists in the diff). If downgrading a stale concern, document why in the `reasoning` field.
- **Draft PR precedence:** if `is_draft: true`, the verdict remains `COMMENT` regardless of unresolved prior concerns. However, the prior discussions must still be surfaced and classified — the draft status overrides the verdict, not the analysis.

#### What to surface

Populate the `prior_discussions` array in the Output Contract for every prior concern found. Include a dedicated **"Prior Discussions"** subsection in the review output listing each item, its status, original severity, and your reasoning.

### Performance (only if relevant)
- Obvious N+1 queries, unnecessary loops, unindexed DB calls?
- Heavy computation in request paths?

## Step 4 — Finding severity scale

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **BLOCKER** | Must be fixed before merge. Correctness bug, security vuln, broken contract, CI failure introduced by this PR. |
| **HIGH** | Serious design or reliability issue. Should fix; discuss if deferring. |
| **MEDIUM** | Real improvement, not blocking. Author should address or explicitly accept risk. |
| **LOW / NIT** | Style, naming, minor cleanup. Don't block merge over these. |
| **QUESTION** | Unclear intent — ask before judging. |

Do not manufacture findings to look thorough. If the code is good, say so.

## Step 5 — Draft review file and get human approval

Before posting anything to GitHub, write a draft markdown file and present it to the user for review and editing.

### Write the draft file

Write all findings to `review-draft-{timestamp}.md` (e.g. `review-draft-2026-04-14T15-44.md`) in the current working directory. The file has two sections per PR: a **Changes Summary** and the **Proposed Comments**.

File format:

```markdown
# Review Draft — {date}

---

## {owner}/{repo}#{number} — {title}

**Author:** {login} | **CI:** passing / failing / pending

**Review Event:** `APPROVE` / `REQUEST_CHANGES` / `COMMENT` ← _edit this to control the formal GitHub review event submitted for this PR_

### Changes Summary

<3–6 sentence plain-English description of what the PR actually does — not the PR description copy-pasted, but your own read of the diff. What files changed, what behavior changed, what was added or removed.>

### Proposed Comments

#### Prior Discussions

| Author | Summary | Status | Orig. Severity | Reasoning |
|--------|---------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| @reviewer-login | brief description of concern | accepted / unresolved / addressed_in_code | BLOCKER / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW | why this status was assigned |

#### Inline Comments

| File | Line | Severity | Comment |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| `path/to/file.ts` | 42 | BLOCKER | {your identity} says: ... |

---

## Cross-PR Summary (for human reviewer only — NOT posted to GitHub)

> **Relationship:** Stacked / Parallel / Batch
> **Overall:** ALL APPROVE / MIXED / ALL REQUEST_CHANGES
>
> | PR | Title | Review Event | Blockers | Highs |
> |----|-------|-------------|----------|-------|
> | #123 | ... | APPROVE | 0 | 1 |
> | #124 | ... | REQUEST_CHANGES | 1 | 0 |
>
> **Integration Concerns:** ...
```

Include every PR in the file, in order. Leave the cross-PR summary at the bottom.

### Present and wait for approval

Tell the user:

> "Draft written to `{filename}`. Open it, make any edits you want — remove findings, soften wording, add context. **The `Review Event` field on each PR controls the formal GitHub review action (APPROVE / REQUEST_CHANGES / COMMENT) — change it if you disagree with my recommendation.** Tell me to post when ready, or say 'post as-is'."

**Do not proceed to Step 6 until the user explicitly says to post.** This gate is not optional — the whole point is to let the human adjust before anything hits GitHub.

### After approval

Re-read the (possibly edited) draft file before posting — use its content as the source of truth for what gets posted, not the original agent outputs. Then delete the draft file after posting completes.

## Step 6 — Post inline comments and submit review

After human approval, re-read the draft file. For each PR:

1. **Parse the `Review Event` field** from the draft file header. Valid values: `APPROVE`, `REQUEST_CHANGES`, `COMMENT`. The human may have changed this from the agent's original recommendation — **always use the value in the file, not the agent's original verdict.**

2. **Post inline comments with the review event** using `gh api`. Use `side: "RIGHT"` for all inline comments. Only post comments for lines confirmed to exist in the diff. Use the content from the approved draft file — not the raw agent output.

```
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews \
  --method POST \
  --field body="" \
  --field event="{REVIEW_EVENT}" \
  --field "comments[][path]=path/to/file.ts" \
  --field "comments[][line]=42" \
  --field "comments[][side]=RIGHT" \
  --field "comments[][body]={your identity} says: <finding>"
```

Where `{REVIEW_EVENT}` is the value read from the draft file's `Review Event` field for that PR (`APPROVE`, `REQUEST_CHANGES`, or `COMMENT`).

3. **If a PR has no inline comments** but the review event is `APPROVE` or `REQUEST_CHANGES`, submit the review without comments:

```
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews \
  --method POST \
  --field body="Reviewed by {your identity}" \
  --field event="{REVIEW_EVENT}"
```

Post reviews for all PRs.

## Step 7 — Review event rules

The agent populates the `Review Event` field in the draft file as its **initial recommendation**. The human can override it before posting. These are the rules for the agent's initial recommendation:

- `APPROVE` — no BLOCKERs or HIGHs (including unresolved prior concerns with original severity BLOCKER or HIGH), CI passing (or failures pre-existing on base)
- `REQUEST_CHANGES` — one or more BLOCKERs or HIGHs introduced by this PR, OR one or more unresolved prior concerns with original severity BLOCKER or HIGH
- `COMMENT` — draft PR (overrides all other events — see below), questions only, or observations with no blocking concerns

**Draft PR precedence:** if `is_draft: true`, the review event is always `COMMENT` regardless of unresolved prior concerns. Prior discussions are still analyzed and surfaced in the output — the draft status overrides the event, not the analysis.

**Human override:** Whatever value the human leaves in the `Review Event` field when they approve the draft is what gets submitted to the GitHub API. The agent's recommendation is just a starting point.

## Step 8 — Notify the user

After posting all reviews:

- Report the per-PR review events submitted (APPROVE / REQUEST_CHANGES / COMMENT) and total finding counts.
- Present the cross-PR summary directly to the user in the conversation (it was already in the draft file; relay the key points).
- Call out any cross-PR integration concerns surfaced.
- If CI failures were introduced by any PR, name the PR and suggest `/resolve-ci-failures`.
- If any PRs have BLOCKERs or HIGHs, list the top concerns briefly.
- This skill covers one review pass. Re-invoke after the author pushes new commits.
